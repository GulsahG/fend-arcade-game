## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Arcade Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## The Game

In this game, you're the player who is supposed to avoid the enemies. You can use the up, down, right, left arrows on your keyboard to move. If you cross the road and get to the sea, your score on the scoreboard gets updated. It gets updated if you bump into some enemies on the road as well. I implemented this classic arcade game to be a Doctor Who Edition as a personal choice. I changed the player to the 11th doctor and enemies to Daleks.
