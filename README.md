## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Arcade Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## The Game

In this game, you're the player who is supposed to avoid the enemies.
* You can use the up, down, right, left arrows on your keyboard to move.
* If you cross the road and get to the sea, your score on the scoreboard gets updated.
* It gets updated if you bump into some enemies on the road as well.
* PS: I implemented this classic arcade game to be a Doctor Who Edition as a personal choice. I changed the player to the 11th doctor and enemies to Daleks.

## Play the Game
